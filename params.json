Currently, it is capable of the following:\r\n* Counting the number of cars in opposing traffic \r\n* Speed estimation of cars in opposing traffic \r\n\r\n\r\nUtilizing these pieces of information, it is capable of traffic estimation, primarily utilizing monocular vision. When combined with an ad hoc car-to-car communication network, in theory, it will be able to generate crowdsourced traffic information.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome features to be implemented in the future:\r\n* Mapping capability to geographically store data\r\n* Robust detection of various traffic signs (stop signs, yield signs, speed limit signs, etc.) \r\n* Detection of obstacles (cars stopped on the road, accidents, major potholes, etc.)\r\n\r\n### The system\r\n\r\n\"Picture of in car assembly\"\r\n\r\nSensors:\r\n* 1 x [Omnivision OV10635 USB 3.0 Camera](https://www.leopardimaging.com/LI-USB30-OV10635.html) <img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/alD2JEN.jpg\" height=\"100\">\r\n\r\n* 1 x [Garmin GPS18-5Hz](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/oem/sensors-and-boards/gps-18x-oem/prod27594.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Traffic Flow\r\nGreeeeeeeeen shield\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMe & Pavan\r\nGorki no no\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nGoogle is yo friend",
