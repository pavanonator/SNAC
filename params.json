Currently, it is capable of the following:\r\n* Counting the number of cars in opposing traffic \r\n* Speed estimation of cars in opposing traffic \r\n* Logging GPS and any OBD data\r\n\r\n\r\nUtilizing this information, it is capable of traffic estimation, primarily using monocular vision. When combined with a wireless communication network, in theory, it will be able to generate crowdsourced traffic information.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome features to be implemented in the future:\r\n* Mapping capability to geographically store data\r\n* Robust detection of various traffic signs (stop signs, yield signs, speed limit signs, etc.) \r\n* Detection of obstacles (cars stopped on the road, accidents, major potholes, etc.)\r\n\r\n### The system\r\n\r\n\"Picture of in car assembly\" rerer\r\n\r\nSensors:\r\n* 1 x [Omnivision OV10635 USB 3.0 Camera](https://www.leopardimaging.com/LI-USB30-OV10635.html) <img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/alD2JEN.png\" height=\"100\" align=\"right\">\r\n* 1 x [Garmin GPS18-5Hz](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/oem/sensors-and-boards/gps-18x-oem/prod27594.html) <img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/QjlafTT.png\" height=\"100\" align=\"right\">\r\n* 1 x [On-board Diagnostics sensor](https://www.amazon.com/Version-Bluetooth-Multi-Language-12Kinds-Android/dp/B00N2K6M2A) <img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ripumje.png\" height=\"100\" align=\"right\">\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>100</td>\r\n    <td>200</td>\r\n    <td>300</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>400</td>\r\n    <td>500</td>\r\n    <td>600</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Methods\r\n![System workflow](http://i.imgur.com/bEm7A89.jpg)\r\nopencv optical flow (farneback)\r\nneural network - trained yolo (reference paper and site) architecture on VOC car images. this gives bounding boxes\r\nbounding box metadata is enough to be able to count how many opposing cars pass by.\r\nwith the culmination of optical flow and bounding box data, a logistic classifier predicts the speed of the vehicle.\r\nfinally greenshield's eq, which requires the count and speeds, outputs a traffic estimate.\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\nAjay Srivastava and Pavan Purohit\r\n{as1877, pp428}@rutgers.edu\r\n",
